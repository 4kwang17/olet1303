# task manager for myself on university info1110

Philosopy of this web application:
simple as possible even chimps can use it at a glance
for my self-learning on info1110
it must be simple but VISUALLY PLEASING DESIGN

task manager web application will have multiple section where I can add or delete
each section will have reminder for myself on my left university work (for alarm)

# brief initial plan
Website name: Time's up!

pops up - for the laziest people on universe like me who doesn't move an inch if not alerted

TITLE

CALENDAR 2023

BLOCK [ + ] -> pops up [day month year [ + ]] -> pops up [day month year [ - ]] -> clicking delete will make a javascript pop-up for re-checking so that user does not delete it for mistake

# add-ons & personal challenge
most source of knowledge on building this web applcation is from info1110 & cs50w
I have to study django, python, html, css, javascript and how to make most out of them

this block and calendar has to be interactive with each other so i have to study more
on date module of the language I will be using

improvements & challenge: I need a research on notification system of this web application to the any device user will be using on.
